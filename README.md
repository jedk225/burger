Node Express Handlebars Assignment

Friend Finder is a a burger logger web app using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern. Users can log burgers into an ongoing list, then mark them as "devoured" once they've eaten the respective burger. The application uses a MySQL database for storage and data persistence.

The purpose of this project is to gain experience on how to use Node and MySQL to query and route data in an app, and use Handlebars to generate HTML.
